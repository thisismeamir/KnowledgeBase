### **1-Year Master Plan for the Foundations of Mathematics**

**(Starting Farvardin, Organized by Quarters and Months)**

This structured plan ensures a rigorous progression through the **absolute foundations** of mathematics, balancing **theory, problem-solving, and computational implementation**.

Each **quarter (3 months)** focuses on a **foundational pillar**, and each **month** within that quarter has **specific goals** with recommended books, exercises, and applications.
