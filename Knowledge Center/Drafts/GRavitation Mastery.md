That's a fantastic ambition! Gravitation is a deep and expansive topic, and MTW (Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler’s "Gravitation") is an excellent foundational reference. Given your expertise in physics and mathematics, you’ll be able to handle the advanced material, but the key to mastering it within a year is to break the content into digestible parts while also ensuring you have a strong conceptual understanding as you go.

Here’s a month-by-month plan to guide you through a deep study of gravitation over the course of the next year.

- **Read Papers:** Start reading relevant papers on topics you’re learning. It’s important to understand how theoretical concepts evolve in modern physics.
- **Simulations and Tools:** Explore numerical relativity and gravitational wave simulations. Tools like SpECTRE and Mathematica will help you gain practical experience.

This plan ensures you're not only covering the material comprehensively but also reinforcing each topic with exercises and further readings. You can adjust the pace depending on how deeply you want to dive into certain topics. Would you like recommendations for more supplementary books or resources on specific topics?
