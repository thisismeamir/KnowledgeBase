### Problem Statement

Consider the time evolution of a density matrix$\rho(t)$in a quantum system described by the following equation:

$$
\dot{\rho} = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \left[ H_0 + e \vec{r} \cdot \vec{E}(t), \rho \right] + \mathcal{L} \{ \rho \}
$$

where:

1. $H_0$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the system.
2. $e \vec{r} \cdot \vec{E}(t)$ represents the interaction term between the electric field $\vec{E}(t)$ and the position operator $\vec{r}$.
3. $\mathcal{L} \{ \rho \}$ is the Lindblad superoperator that accounts for dissipative effects in the system.
4. The electric field is expressed as $\vec{E}(t) = \epsilon \vec{F}(t)$ , where $\epsilon$ is a small perturbation parameter and$\vec{F}(t)$ is the field's normalized profile.

The density matrix $\rho(t)$ is expanded as a power series in$\epsilon$:

$$
\rho_\epsilon(t) = \rho^{(0)}(t) + \epsilon \rho^{(1)}(t) + \epsilon^2 \rho^{(2)}(t) + \ldots + \epsilon^n \rho^{(n)}(t)
$$

Each term $\rho^{(k)}(t)$ corresponds to the $k$-th order contribution to $\rho(t)$.

### Tasks:

1. **Zeroth-Order Equation**: Derive the equation governing the zeroth-order density matrix 
 $\rho^{(0)}(t)$, which is independent of the perturbation $\epsilon$.  Show that it satisfies:
  $$
   \dot{\rho}^{(0)}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar} [H_0, \rho^{(0)}] + \mathcal{L} \{ \rho^{(0)} \}
  $$

2. **Higher-Order Equation**: Derive the equation for the $i$ -th order density matrix $\rho^{(i)}(t)$ ($i > 1$) as a function of the previous order $\rho^{(i-1)}(t)$. Show that it satisfies:
  $$
   \dot{\rho}^{(i)}(t) = -\frac{i}{\hbar} [H_0, \rho^{(i)}] + \mathcal{L} \{ \rho^{(i)} \} - \frac{i}{\hbar} \left[ e \vec{r} \cdot \vec{F}, \rho^{(i-1)} \right]
  $$

Provide clear derivations for both cases, showing all necessary steps in detail.

### Solution

#### Zeroth-Order Equation

From the given density matrix evolution equation:

$$
\dot{\rho} = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \left[ H_0 + e \vec{r} \cdot \vec{E}(t), \rho \right] + \mathcal{L} \{ \rho \}
$$

Expand $\rho(t)$ in powers of $\epsilon$:

$$
\rho_\epsilon(t) = \rho^{(0)}(t) + \epsilon \rho^{(1)}(t) + \epsilon^2 \rho^{(2)}(t) + \ldots
$$

Substituting this expansion into the evolution equation, collect terms of order $\epsilon^0$:

$$
\dot{\rho}^{(0)} = -\frac{i}{\hbar} [H_0, \rho^{(0)}] + \mathcal{L} \{ \rho^{(0)} \}
$$

This shows that the zeroth-order density matrix $\rho^{(0)}$ evolves under the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$ and the Lindblad superoperator $\mathcal{L}$.

#### Higher-Order Equation

Consider the first-order correction in $\epsilon$. The electric field $\vec{E}(t) = \epsilon \vec{F}(t)$ introduces perturbations into the evolution equation. Substituting the series expansion into the evolution equation and collecting terms of order$\epsilon^i$gives:

$$
\dot{\rho}^{(i)} = -\frac{i}{\hbar} [H_0, \rho^{(i)}] + \mathcal{L} \{ \rho^{(i)} \} - \frac{i}{\hbar} \left[ e \vec{r} \cdot \vec{F}, \rho^{(i-1)} \right]
$$

This equation shows that the evolution of $\rho^{(i)}$ depends on both the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$, the Lindblad superoperator $\mathcal{L}$, and the interaction term involving the previous order $\rho^{(i-1)}$.
Thus, the recursive relationship for higher-order terms is established, completing the derivation.
