# Introduction
Science community has been the key factor of development of civilizations. By Producing innovative theories, technologies and methods. Over the course of history, science has grown from an open dialogue to exclusive institutions. This was mainly because of local societies (countries) caring about knowledge and values it brings to the table.

But at the heart of this epistemological method, lies the collaborative, sharing model that helps science cleans, refactor, and adjust itself as our understanding of it grows. This was the backbone of what enabled us to make civilizations, have revolutions in our perspective and make technologies.

Institutions and Academia has grown little to none in the centuries we passed behind. A clear factor of such little improve is encouragements that were necessary to do so, after all if the model works, why change it? 

In the following Manifesto we argue that the model of current academia is highly hierarchical, restricted, resistant to innovation, and paywalled. Although it is increasingly getting punished for such attributes (inside and outside of it), there's no alternative. We present this alternative as a form of ideology and an Organization. We try to answer the questions arising from such suggestion. *"Can we democratize science further? Are there existing models that work outside of academia? and if so does it preserve the rigor behind our method?"* 

We believe that the change lies behind a well-known model; *"Open-Collaboration*, gained a lot of interest in software development community and is committed to an ideology that resembles most part of our model. Thereafter we would include some background, attempts, and vision of how *Independent Society of Knowledge* can be the next step for scientific community.
# 20th Century Revolutions
20th Century, marks as a groundbreaking century for humanity. It was a revolution in many fields but most notably in science and academia. From the theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity, to world wars, space race, cold war, civil rights, and the birth of internet.
