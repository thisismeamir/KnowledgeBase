Analyzing algorithms means predicting the resources that the algorithm requires. These resources can be memory, bandwidth, energy, and  others, but most importantly (a type of resource that indirectly influences all the others) is the computational time.

Before analyzing you need a model of the technology that the algorithm would run on.
