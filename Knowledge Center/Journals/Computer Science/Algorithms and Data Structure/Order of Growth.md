In algorithm analysis what matters most to us is the *rate of growth*, or [[Order of Growth]]. We therefore consider only leading terms of a formula, since the lower-order terms are relatively negligible for large input size. We also ignore the leading terms constant coefficient, since constant factors are less significant rather than the rate of the growth in determining computational efficiency for large inputs.

To highlight the order of growth we have a special notation $\Theta$. We write that insertion sort has a worst-case running time of $\Theta(n^2)$.
