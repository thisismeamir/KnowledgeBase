A static matter distribution is modeled by a time-independent stress-energy tensor in the form:
$$
T_{\mu\nu} = \rho t_\mu t_\nu, \ T_{00} = \rho(x^i), T_{0i} = T_{ij} = 0
$$
where $t^\mu$ is the vector along the time direction of the global inertial coordinates. With this prescription, the right hand side of [[Weak Field Limit of General Relativity]]linearized Einstein tensor is time-independent, thus also the gravitational field must be time independent.
$$
\partial_t \bar h_{\mu\nu} = 0
$$
and the linearized EFE reduce to Poisson equations for the components of the metric field:

$$
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
\Delta \bar h_{\mu\nu} = -16\pi \rho, & \mu = \nu = 0 \\
\Delta h_{\mu\nu} = 0 ,  \text{otherwise}
\end{matrix}
\right.
$$
The Poisson equations have boundary values 
$$
h_{ij} |_{r\rightarrow \infty} =0 
$$
Hence, the solution of the $00$ equation is immediately given in terms of the Newton gravitational potential by formally comparing to Newton's $\Delta \phi = 4\pi\rho$. The solution of the other equations (without source terms) is simply zero:
$$
\left\{ 
\begin{matrix}
\bar h_{\mu\nu} = -4\phi, & \mu=\nu = 0\\
\bar h_{\mu\nu} = 0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{matrix} \ \ \ \Rightarrow \bar h_{\mu\nu} = -4\phi t_\mu t_\nu
\right.
$$
Reversing the trace:
$$
\begin{align}
\bar h &= \eta^{\mu\nu} \bar h_{\mu\nu} = \eta^{00}\bar h_{00} =4\phi\\
h_{\mu\nu} &= \bar h_{\mu\nu} - \frac12 \eta_{\mu\nu} \bar h
 = -4\phi t_\mu t_\nu
 -\frac12 \eta_{\mu\nu} (4\phi)\\
 g_{\mu\nu} &= \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}(1-2\phi) - 4\phi t_\mu t_\nu
 \end{align}

$$
\boxed{
g_{\mu\nu}\approx -\left(1 +\frac{2\phi}{c^2}\right)c^2 dt^2 + \delta_{ij} dx^i dx^j

$$
Far from a source of mass $M$ the multipolar expansion of gravitational potential starts with $\phi\approx -\frac M r + \mathcal{O}(1/r^2)$, so the distant metric is fully specified by the source mass and reduces to Minkowski at $r\rightarrow \infty$, or everywhere if $M\equiv 0$. 

> [!EXAMPLE] Deflection of Light
> *Consider a photon moving in a weak and static gravtiational field generated by a mass $M$. The metric given above applies with gravitational potential being $\phi = GM/rc^2$. The photon moves in the $z=0$ plane in direction $x$ with impact parameter $y=b$. Setting $d\ell^2 = \delta_{ij}dx^i dx^j$ and interpreting the $d$ as differential, the coordinate speed of the photon can be computer from the condition $g=0$ *

> v = \frac{d\ell}{dt} = c\left(\frac{1-2\phi}{1+2\phi}\right)^{1/2} \approx c(1-2\phi)= c\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)

> where the square root is expanded. The speed of light measured in these non-inertial coordinates decreases the closer the photon approach to the mass. This is analogous to a wave front passing through a medium in which the speed of the wave varies with position. Hence, a beam of light rays is bent towards the mass the closer is to the mass. The deflection can be calculated using Huygen's principle in analogous way of waves in a medium,
