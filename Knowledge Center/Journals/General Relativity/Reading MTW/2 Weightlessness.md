# Weightlessness
Free fall is synonymous with weightlessness: *absence of any force to drive the object away from its normal track through space-time.*  Travel abroad a spaceship in that state of steady fall toward earth that marks a circular orbit. Then you experience weightlessness, and a natural track through spacetime.

> Free fall is the natural state of motion.

The traveler has one chemical composition, so different than what the spaceship has; yet they travel with each other. Objects of such different nuclear constitution as aluminum and gold fall with acceleration that agree to better than one part in $10^{11}$.  This has been found by Roll, Krotkov, and Dicke in 1964, one of the most important null experiments in all physics. 

> All objects fall with the same acceleration.

Individual molecules fall in step, too, with macroscopic objects \[Estermann, Simpson and Stern 1938\]. And so does neutrons \[Dabbs, Harvey, Paya and Horstmann 1965\]. Even individual electrons, or mu mesons. 

> Eliminate the acceleration by use of a local inertial frame!

Physics looks as complicated to the jet-driven observer as it does to the man on the ground. Rule out both observers to make physics look simple. Instead, travel abroad the freely moving spaceship. Nothing could be more natural than what one sees: every free object moves in a straight line with uniform velocity. 

> Work in a very special coordinate system: a coordinate frame in which one is weightless; *a local inertial frame of reference.*

Newton spoke differently: "Absolute space, in its own nature, without relation to anything external, remains always similar and immovable." But how does one give meaning to Newton's absolute space, and mark out its straight lines? In the real world of gravitation, no particle ever follows these straight lines. ==The "*ideal straight line*" is a myth. **It never happened, and it never will**==

1. Physics is always and everywhere *locally Lorentzian*.
2. This simplicity shows most clearly in a local Lorentz frame of reference (*inertial frame of reference*)
3. ==To test for a local Lorentz frame, test for weightlessness!==
