# Time
> Time is defined so that motion looks simple.

We say that "*Relative to a local Lorentz frame, a free particle*  moves in a straight line with uniform velocity". We now know what straight would mean in a local lorentz frame but what about "uniform velocity"? 

A more fully developed model of a Lorentz reference frame will have holes and clock-activated shutters over each hole. The projectile can reach its target only if.

1. It travels through the correct region in space.
2. Gets through that hole in the correct interval of time.

> Good clock make spacetime trajectories of free particles look straight. 


> Our choice of unit for measuring time: the geometrodynamic centimeter.

The principle of uniformity, taken by itself, leaves free the scale of the time variable. The history of timekeeping discloses many choices of the unit and origin of time. Each one required some human action to give it sanction. 

Space-like intervals and time-like intervals are measured in terms of one and the same geometric unit: the centimeter. Any other decision would complicate in analysis what is simple in nature.

No other choice would live up to Minkowski's word, 
> *"Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality"*

**Definition of the centimeter: *The Geometric standard centimeter is the fraction $1/(9.460546 \times 10^{17})$ of the interval between the two "effective equinoxes" that bound the topical year 1900.0.***
