# Effect of Mass on Curvature
As the figure below shows a sphere of the same density, $\rho = 5.52 g/cm^3$, as the average density of the Earth. A hole is bored through this sphere. Two test particles, $A$ and $B$, execute simple harmonic motion in this hole, with an 84-minute period. 

Therefore, their geodesic separation $\xi$, however it may be oriented, undergoes a simple periodic motion with the same 84-minute period

$$
\frac{d^2\xi^j}{d\tau^2} = -\left(
\frac{4\pi}{3}\rho
\right)\xi^j
$$
Comparing this actual motion with the equation of geodesic deviation for slowly moving particles in a nearly inertial frame, we can read off some of the curvature components for the interior of this model Earth.

R^{\hat x}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat x\hat 0} & R^{\hat y}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat x\hat 0} & R^{\hat z}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat x\hat 0}\\
R^{\hat x}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat y\hat 0} & R^{\hat y}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat y\hat 0} & R^{\hat z}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat y\hat 0}\\ 
R^{\hat x}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat z\hat 0} & R^{\hat y}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat z\hat 0} & R^{\hat z}_{\cdot \hat 0\hat z\hat 0}
\end{bmatrix} =(4\pi\rho/3) \begin{bmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}

> Effect of gravitational wave on Riemann tensor

Let a gravitational wave from a supernova pass through the Earth. Idealize the Earth's matter as so nearly incompressible that its density remains practically unchanged.
