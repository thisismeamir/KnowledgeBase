###### Freedom, Open-Source, and Science
Knowledge is obtained by hard work. At the time I was studying in university, I found it hard to gain knowledge. This wasn't because of academia per-say. Yes, Academia is rigged in my opinion, from inside and from outside. The game is different than what we tell our younger generation.

But Obtaining of knowledge is something different than the game. What I mean was that it's hard to look up different articles, research, and find out. 

You should be able to have freedom in it. That's for sure, but when I *find out* should I make it free? open-source? and is there a difference between the two? This is not only about the way we publish our research, but also about communities, countries, and universities that are formed to tell the younger ones, what's the current state of our understanding or the universe.

I think its important to ask this question, should knowledge be free? should it cost money? and can obtaining knowledge happen on a community at global scale?
