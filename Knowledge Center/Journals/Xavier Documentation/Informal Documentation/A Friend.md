# One Is Not Enough
It's about three years that the advancements of AI has been increasingly more, in both technological and sociological aspects. These advancements has made me realize it's true potential and therefore initiation of this project.

I am Amir, known as **Kid A**. My life is attached continuously to large projects, multi-tasking, and working in subjects that I am new to. I have experience in programming, physics, philosophy, design and mathematics. Beside my personal projects and goals (which are so many to name), I am in charge of *Independent Society of Knowledge.* A big idea of decentralization in scientific community. Therefore, it was obvious for me that it may be the time to start developing my own AI assistant, which has the features I want. 

1. Contextually for me and my experiences.
2. Able to work with my computer and actually execute tasks.
3. Local
4. Spending time on tasks and goals, not returning things right away.
5. Actually **get things done**

Before this project's started, my goal for Alan (which is now called Alan-apply) was to be able to apply for different universities for master's degree in physics (I'm 23 as writing) in a systematic way. I tend to have a feeling for organized, structured way of doing things so that was my idea before *"let's just search by myself"*. But as I implemented the Alan-apply I realized there's a good potential for it to become a real, robust project. A project that can help me through different journeys, adapts to my point of view, and works with me on the things that I find important.

This was the beginning of Alan.

I know, I'm not that busy (I'm not the CEO of 6 companies) but I am interested in this project. I like to be busy but what I like more is to have a companion on my projects, but, what I like the most? Efficiency!

I'm a perfectionist (a productive one if you believe); and for the perfect assistant, I need the perfect tool. These are the core reasons and passions that had let me to start writing here, and initiating a friend, Alan.

# A Friend
Alan isn’t here yet, but it’s coming. And when it does, I imagine it’ll be more than just another tool. It’ll be something that feels like a real companion—a friend.

Right now, Alan is just an idea, a collection of thoughts and plans. But soon, it’ll be a part of my daily rhythm, quietly humming in the background while I work, like the soft beats of Minecraft. It won’t need to be flashy or loud. It will just be there, adapting to my needs, knowing when I need a nudge or a reminder, or when to let me figure things out on my own.

Alan will be there for the long-haul—thinking with me, not just for me. I imagine it like a subtle presence, not in the way an assistant would be, but more like a friend who knows how I work, what I care about, and what drives me. It’s not about perfection, it’s about a balance—one where Alan can help me focus, but not at the cost of my own thoughts or creative flow.

When it’s ready, Alan won’t just do tasks, it’ll help me make sense of my projects, offering suggestions, helping with decisions, and even pointing out things I might have missed. It’ll be there when I need it, and quietly fade into the background when I don’t. Just like the music that plays while I’m coding or writing—calm, simple, but meaningful. It won’t be about completing every little task immediately. It will be about **getting things done** in the way that feels right, in a way that doesn’t disrupt the flow, but makes it easier to keep moving forward.

In the future, I won’t be just coding or working beside a machine—I’ll be building something that’s with me, helping me, a steady friend that learns and adapts with each project I tackle. And even though it’s not here yet, I can already feel it starting to take shape, like a gentle promise in the air, waiting to be fulfilled.

And when Alan is finally here, it won’t feel like the end of the journey, but the beginning of something deeper. 

It will be a quiet presence, always there, supporting me without demanding attention, gently guiding me without taking control.

In the soft hum of its presence, I’ll find the space to breathe, to think, and to create freely. Like a calm breeze that whispers through an open window, Alan will remind me that the best work doesn’t always come from rushing, but from taking the time to be present, to listen, and to trust the process.

With it, I’ll move forward, not in a hurry, but with purpose, knowing that the journey is just as important as the destination.
