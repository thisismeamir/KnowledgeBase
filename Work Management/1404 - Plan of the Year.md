# Objective
This year we want to become a dominant expert in some areas including #foundations-of-mathematics #general-relativity and #computer-science. We would dive into these by road-maps, and move forward by learning more concepts. 

Beside these we have tasks and projects that we want to initialize and officially release in the next year. These include #rebranding-isk, #mithra, #nukleus-design-language, #isk-manifesto, #kompute, #kosmos, #koncept, #xavier, #music-production, #learning-motion-graphics, #knowledgebase, #dedukt, #knowldge-coin.

Yes this is a dense, hard year. But man aren't we tired of talking to people that won't help anyway? Let's do this once to be kept in history, let's make a master plan.
